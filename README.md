# Hello World Voting Ethereum Dapp Tutorial

## Part 1
The application is extremely simple, all it does is initialize a set of contestants, let anyone vote for the candidates and display the total votes received by each candidate. The goal is not to just code an application but to learn the process of compiling, deploying and interacting with it.

I have deliberately avoided using any dapp frameworks to build this application because the frameworks abstract away lot of the details and you fail to understand the internals of the system. Also, when you do use a framework, you will have more appreciation for all the heavy lifting the framework does for you!

In lot of ways, this article is a continuation of the previous post. If you are new to the world of Ethereum, I recommend reading it before continuing.

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Set up the development environment.
- Learn the process of writing a contract, compiling it and deploying it in your development environment.
- Interact with the contract on the blockchain through a nodejs console.
- Interact with the contract through a simple web page to display the vote counts and vote for candidates through the page.

## Part 2
In this tutorial, we will accomplish the following:

- Install geth — the client software used to download the blockchain and run the Ethereum node on your local machine.
- Install the Ethereum dapp framework called Truffle which will be used for compiling and deploying our contract.
- Make small updates to our Voting application to make it work using truffle.
- Compile and deploy the contract to the Ropsten testnet.
- Interact with the contract through truffle console and then through a webpage.

## Part 3
Here is what you will learn in this tutorial:

- Learn to use new data types like struct to organize and store data on the blockchain.
- Learn the concept of tokens and its usage.
- Learn to make payments using Ether, the currency of the Ethereum blockchain platform.
